Deep Reinforcement Learning in Pytorch
https://github.com/navneet-nmk/pytorch-rl

	pytorch-rl implements some state-of-the art deep reinforcement learning algorithms in Pytorch, 
	especially those concerned with continuous action spaces. 
	You can train your algorithm efficiently either on CPU or GPU. 
	Furthermore, pytorch-rl works with OpenAI Gym out of the box. 
	This means that evaluating and playing around with different algorithms is easy.
